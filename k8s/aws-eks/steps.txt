step 1. eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yaml
(this should create the ec2 and eks cluster, also check cloud formation)
to checkit created run kubectl get nodes.
If all is well, you should see the worker node(s) in a Ready state and also
run kubectl config get-cluster
to list the pods, run kubectl get pods -A , kubectl get nodes
step 2: create a namespace.
step 3 create deployment
to check kubectl get deploymemt -n stagging
step 4. create the service
to see all created services run kubectl get all -n stagging

Now we need services from the internet to access our pods in our cluster.

we use subnet.
step 5. updated the subnet tagunder VPC  with the details in the subnet-tags.txt file 
step 6:  create an IAM policy that has permission to create a loadbalancer on AWS.
use the iam policy command in the commands.txt file.
step 7. install aws load balancer controller.
